      - title: What happens in a Biodanza class?
        content: |
          Biodanza is a movement practice ...
      - title: What do I need to bring to the class?
        content: >
          Comfortable, loose fitting clothes. Some water to stay hydrated.
          Biodanza is normally danced barefoot, so no footwear is necessary.
          However, soft dance shoes can be worn if there is a need to wear
          shoes.
      - title: How do you base your pricing?
        content: |
          Pricing on a non-judgemental scale.
      - title: What if my business is technical?
        content: >-
          No product or service is too technical to learn and understand. Part
          of our initial onboarding is an in-depth understanding of your
          offerings, your target audience and your level of technical writing
          needed.
      - title: How fast can we get started?
        content: >-
          The onboarding process typically lasts 3-4 days and consists of an
          intro video call, an interview, a questionnaire and some back and
          forth communication for technical purposes. After that, we can go as
          fast as you need.
      - title: Who handles the design?
        content: >-
          You can choose to provide the design yourself, or I can include a
          design element to your proposal. I work with several wonderful
          designers with ample experience in web, digital, campaign and
          marketing design.
