      - title: What happens in a Biodanza class?
        content: |
          Biodanza is a movement practice ...
      - title: What do I need to bring to the class?
        content: >
          Comfortable, loose fitting clothes. Some water to stay hydrated.
          Biodanza is normally danced barefoot, so no footwear is necessary.
          However, soft dance shoes can be worn if there is a need to wear
          shoes.

          Pricing on a non-judgemental scale.

          Biodanza is a very inclusive practice. It is not about performance or
          style. No steps or choreography.
      - title: Who handles the design?
        content: >-
          You can choose to provide the design yourself, or I can include a
          design element to your proposal. I work with several wonderful
          designers with ample experience in web, digital, campaign and
          marketing design.
