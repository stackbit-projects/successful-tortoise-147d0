# What is Biodanza?

#####  

#### Biodanza is a system&#xA;that promotes health, wellbeing, joy and relaxation through specific&#xA;dance and group movement exercises that are induced by the rhythm and&#xA;melody of inspiring music. It develops various levels of connection and&#xA;bonding with oneself, with one another, and with the universe. And it opens the&#xA;individual to owning and joyfully expressing ones true identity. 

##### Biodanza sees The human being as a comprehensiveness  of the biological, the psychological and the&#xA;social as well of  the emotional,&#xA;behavioral, mental and bodily, it is this unity that generates harmony and&#xA;balance in human development.

##### The creator of the  Biodanza &#xA;was Rolando Toro Araneda , during his work on a mental institution he&#xA;realized  how music and movement could induce&#xA;many emotional and physical states, enabling integration and balance or the&#xA;opposite. Because Rolando followed many careers, including school teacher,&#xA;psychologist, honorary medical doctor, medical researcher, poet, artist,&#xA;African art collector and anthropologist – all of them contributed to the&#xA;development of Biodanza System, been this the work of his life .

##### Nowadays there is more than 100&#xA;Biodanza Schools around the world and the System keeps evolving with more&#xA;experiences and researches. There is further qualification to facilitated&#xA;specific  groups, working with Children&#xA;and Teenagers was  a very Important&#xA;matter for Rolando and the whole community of Biodanza since the beginning,.

#####  What&#xA;are the effects of Biodanza?

##### From a physiological&#xA;point of view:

##### Biodanza works as an anti-stress&#xA;therapy, helping to regulate sleep and blood pressure.  It gives&#xA;participants a feeling of expanded vital life force energy, and helps&#xA;develop the ability to self-regulate, balancing action and rest, and&#xA;strengthening the individual's immune system.

##### ​

##### From a psychological&#xA;point of view:

##### Biodanza works as an&#xA;antidepressant.  The stimulation from the music, movement and&#xA;relationship with the group provoke a positive reaction, that is&#xA;reinforced by the physiological effect of the class; during the first part of&#xA;class, rhythm and joy,  stimulate adrenaline and&#xA;noradrenaline and, in the second part of class as we let go and return to&#xA;our divine essence, dopamine, serotonin and oxytocin are stimulated&#xA;regulating mood and generating well-being.

#####  

##### From an existential point&#xA;of view:

##### Biodanza&#xA;reinforces self-esteem, because we stimulate the joy and pleasure of&#xA;being alive.  It improves relationships with others, and reinforces a&#xA;confidence in personal self-expression. 

#####  

##### Dance&#xA;movement encounter and non verbal communication

##### Biodanza has great potential for&#xA;children and young people who find traditional classroom learning approaches&#xA;difficult. The physical movement and emotional energy is a release from&#xA;activities based solely on the intellect. It provides a refreshing and&#xA;innovative alternative for auditory and visual learners too.

##### Biodanza is a natural fit within&#xA;the expressive arts of drama, dance and music, as well as within the non-statutory&#xA;PSHE curriculum
