Biodanza
as a path to learning is new in England, but has been used in Scotland,
Ireland, France, Holland, Belgium, Spain, Italy, Portugal and South America
with remarkable results





What is
Biodanza ?

 

Biodanza is a form of expression
that promotes health, wellbeing, joy and relaxation through specific
dance and group movement exercises that are induced by the rhythm and
melody of inspiring music. It develops various levels of connection and
bonding with oneself, with one another, and with the universe. And it opens the
individual to owning and joyfully expressing ones true identity. 

Biodanza sees The human being as a comprehensiveness  of the biological, the psychological and the
social as well of  the emotional,
behavioral, mental and bodily, it is this unity that generates harmony and
balance in human development.

The creator of the  Biodanza 
was Rolando Toro Araneda , during his work on a mental institution he
realized  how music and movement could induce
many emotional and physical states, enabling integration and balance or the
opposite. Because Rolando followed many careers, including school teacher,
psychologist, honorary medical doctor, medical researcher, poet, artist,
African art collector and anthropologist – all of them contributed to the
development of Biodanza System, been this the work of his life .

Nowadays there is more than 100
Biodanza Schools around the world and the System keeps evolving with more
experiences and researches. There is further qualification to facilitated
specific  groups, working with Children
and Teenagers was  a very Important
matter for Rolando and the whole community of Biodanza since the beginning,.

 

 

BIODANZA, from :

Bio = Life       Danza =Dance

THE DANCE OF THE LIFE

 

 What
are the effects of Biodanza?

From a physiological
point of view:

Biodanza works as an anti-stress
therapy, helping to regulate sleep and blood pressure.  It gives
participants a feeling of expanded vital life force energy, and helps
develop the ability to self-regulate, balancing action and rest, and
strengthening the individual's immune system.

​

From a psychological
point of view:

Biodanza works as an
antidepressant.  The stimulation from the music, movement and
relationship with the group provoke a positive reaction, that is
reinforced by the physiological effect of the class; during the first part of
class, rhythm and joy,  stimulate adrenaline and
noradrenaline and, in the second part of class as we let go and return to
our divine essence, dopamine, serotonin and oxytocin are stimulated
regulating mood and generating well-being.

 

From an existential point
of view:

Biodanza
reinforces self-esteem, because we stimulate the joy and pleasure of
being alive.  It improves relationships with others, and reinforces a
confidence in personal self-expression. 

 

Dance
movement encounter and non verbal communication

Biodanza has great potential for
children and young people who find traditional classroom learning approaches
difficult. The physical movement and emotional energy is a release from
activities based solely on the intellect. It provides a refreshing and
innovative alternative for auditory and visual learners too.

Biodanza is a natural fit within
the expressive arts of drama, dance and music, as well as within the non-statutory
PSHE curriculum
